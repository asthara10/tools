# To nf-core or not to nf-core?

Next, we need to know what kind of pipeline this will be.

Choose _"nf-core"_ if:

* You want your pipeline to be part of the nf-core community
* You think that there's an outside chance that it ever _could_ be part of nf-core

Choose _"Custom"_ if:

* Your pipeline will _never_ be part of nf-core
* You want full control over *all* features that are included from the template
    (including those that are mandatory for nf-core).
"""

## Not sure? What's the difference?

Choosing _"nf-core"_ effectively pre-selects the following template features:

* GitHub Actions Continuous Integration (CI) configuration for the following:
    * Small-scale (GitHub) and large-scale (AWS) tests
    * Code format linting with prettier
    * Auto-fix functionality using @nf-core-bot
    * Marking old issues as stale
* Inclusion of shared nf-core config profiles
